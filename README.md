# Paint by GAN
Implementation of a binary classification convolutional neural network (CNN) that differentiates between Paul Cezanne and Vincent van Gogh paintings and an attempt at a generative adversarial network (GAN) to generate novel art using Kaggle's Painter by Numbers Dataset. The GAN component of this project is still a work in progress.
